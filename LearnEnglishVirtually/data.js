[{"id": 1, "topic": "Word", "content": "<h1><strong>Word</strong></h1>\r\n\r\n<p>In both written and spoken language, a <strong>word </strong>refers to a speech sound or a combination of two or more speech sounds. In linguistics, a word serves as a sign to represent/refer to something or someone in order to convey a certain meaning.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A <strong>word</strong> is a single linguistic unit. <strong>Verbs, nouns, adjectives, and adverbs</strong> are the four main <strong>word classes</strong>. A <strong>sentence</strong> is the most fundamental unit of grammar, consisting of a subject, a verb phrase, and, occasionally, a compliment. A <strong>sentence</strong> is a grammatical unit. There must be at least one main clause in it. A <strong>sentence</strong> starts with a capital letter and concludes with a full stop in writing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Examples: &lsquo;love&rsquo;, &lsquo;cricket&rsquo;, &lsquo;sky&rsquo; etc.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A speech sound, or a combination of speech sounds, must meet many characteristics in order to be considered a <strong>word</strong>.</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Between two words, there must be a potential stop in voice and a space in written form. Assume that the words &#39;ball&#39; and &#39;bat&#39; are not interchangeable. As a result, if we employ them in a sentence, we must allow for a possible pause after each one. It cannot be like &ldquo;Ilikeplayingcricket&rdquo;. If we take pause, these sounds can be regarded as four distinct words which are &lsquo;I&rsquo;, &lsquo;like&rsquo;, &rsquo;playing&rsquo;, cricket&rsquo;.</li>\r\n\t<li>At least one root must be present in every word. It can no longer be a word if this root is broken. The word &#39;unfaithful,&#39; for example, comes from the root &#39;faith.&#39; These sounds will not be considered words if we separate &#39;faith&#39; into &#39;fa&#39; and &#39;ith.&#39;</li>\r\n\t<li>Every word must have a meaning. In the <strong>English language</strong>, for example, the sound &#39;bhanana&#39; has no meaning.

Although it is common to equate <strong>Weak Verbs</strong> with Regular Verbs, not all <strong>Weak Verbs</strong> in the English language are Regular Verbs.</p>\r\n<p>Examples:</p>\r\n<table width=\"306\">\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td width=\"180\">\r\n<p><strong>Present Indefinite</strong></p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td width=\"126\">\r\n<p><strong>Past Indefinite</strong></p>\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td width=\"180\">\r\n<p>Spend</p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td width=\"126\">\r\n<p>Spent</p>\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td width=\"180\">\r\n<p>Walk</p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td width=\"126\">\r\n<p>Walked</p>\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td width=\"180\">\r\n<p>Book</p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td width=\"126\">\r\n<p>Booked</p>\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td width=\"180\">\r\n<p>Learn</p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td width=\"126\">\r\n<p>Learnt</p>\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td width=\"180\">\r\n<p>Want</p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td width=\"126\">\r\n<p>Wanted</p>\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h2>Strong Verb</h2>\r\n<p>In the Present Indefinite to Past Indefinite to Past Participle form of verbs, <strong>strong verbs</strong> have vowels that shift from I to \"a\" to \"u\" in the verb stem.</p>\r\n<p>Examples:</p>\r\n<table width=\"385\">\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td width=\"147\">\r\n<p><strong>Present Indefinite</strong></p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td width=\"119\">\r\n<p><strong>Past Indefinite</strong></p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td width=\"119\">\r\n<p><strong>Past Participle</strong></p>\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td width=\"147\">\r\n<p>Ring</p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td width=\"119\">\r\n<p>Rang</p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td width=\"119\">\r\n<p>Rung</p>\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td width=\"147\">\r\n<p>Drink</p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td width=\"119\">\r\n<p>Drank</p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td width=\"119\">\r\n<p>Drunk</p>\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td width=\"147\">\r\n<p>Cling</p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td width=\"119\">\r\n<p>Clang</p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td width=\"119\">\r\n<p>Clung</p>\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td width=\"147\">\r\n<p>Swim</p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td width=\"119\">\r\n<p>Swam</p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td width=\"119\">\r\n<p>Swum</p>\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td width=\"147\">\r\n<p>Sing</p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td width=\"119\">\r\n<p>Sang</p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td width=\"119\">\r\n<p>Sung</p>\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td width=\"147\">\r\n<p>Wring</p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td width=\"119\">\r\n<p>Wrang</p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td width=\"119\">\r\n<p>Wrung</p>\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n<h2>Finite Verbs</h2>\r\n<p><strong>Finite verbs</strong> are the actual verbs that make up a sentence's roots. It is a type of verb that is performed by or relates to a subject and utilizes one of the twelve tense forms, which varies depending on the number or person of the subject.</p>\r\n<p>Examples:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Bijay plays basketball.</li>\r\n<li>They are playing for Nepal.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h2>Non-finite Verbs</h2>\r\n<p><strong>Non-finite verbs</strong> aren't really verbs at all. They don't function as verbs in sentences; instead, they function as nouns, adjectives, adverbs, and so on. Because non-finite verbs, also known as verbal, have no direct link to the subject, they do not vary according to the number/person of the subject.</p>\r\n<p>Examples:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Playing football is her only job. (Present participle)</li>\r\n<li>She has a broken fan. (Past participle)</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h2>Action Verbs</h2>\r\n<p><strong>Action verbs</strong> describe what the sentence's subject does. <strong>Action verbs</strong> can help the listener/reader experience emotions and visualize scenes more clearly and precisely. There are <strong>two</strong> types of <strong>action verbs</strong>:<strong> transitive</strong> and <strong>intransitive</strong>.</p>\r\n<h3>Transitive verbs</h3>\r\n<p>A direct object is required for transitive verbs. A transitive verb necessitates the action of something or someone.</p>\r\n<p>Examples:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>She <strong>painted</strong> her room.</li>\r\n<li>He <strong>is reading</strong> the novel.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h3>Intransitive verbs</h3>\r\n<p>Nothing is acted upon by <strong>intransitive verbs</strong>. An adjective, adverb, preposition, or another component of speech may come after them.</p>\r\n<p>Examples:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>She <strong>smiled</strong>.</li>\r\n<li>I <strong>wake</strong> up at 10 AM.\\</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h2>Linking Verb</h2>\r\n<p>A connecting verb adds information about the sentence's topic. It connects the subject and the complement &mdash; that is, the words that come after the <strong>linking verb</strong> &mdash; in its most basic form. Instead of presenting activity, it establishes a connection between them.</p>\r\n<p>Examples:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>The food <strong>seemed</strong></li>\r\n<li>You <strong>look</strong></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h2>Auxiliary Verbs</h2>\r\n<p>Helping verbs are another name for <strong>auxiliary verbs</strong>. <strong>Auxiliary verbs</strong> assist to convey time, tense, and potential by extending the primary verb. Be verbs, have, and do are&nbsp;<strong>auxiliary verbs</strong>.</p>\r\n<p>Examples:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong>Do</strong> you drink coffee?</li>\r\n<li><strong>Don&rsquo;t</strong> waste your time.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h2>Modal Verbs</h2>\r\n<p>A <strong>modal verb</strong> is similar to an auxiliary verb in that it has two parts. It is used to imply possibility, potentiality, capacity, permission, anticipation, and duty in conjunction with the primary verb.</p>\r\n<p>Examples:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>He<strong> should</strong> call him.</li>\r\n<li>She <strong>will</strong> go there.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h2>Reflexive Verb</h2>\r\n<p>The <strong>Reflexive Verb</strong> occurs when the Subject and Object are the same and the verb reflects on the Subject. These verbs are frequently employed with reflexive pronouns such as myself, he, her, it, and so on.</p>\r\n<p>Examples:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>She has done it himself.</li>\r\n<li>She'll watch it herself.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h2>Ergative Verb</h2>\r\n<p><strong>Ergative verbs</strong> can be used to express both transitive and intransitive meanings. In English, they're referred to as <strong>Labile Verbs</strong>.</p>\r\n<p>Examples:</p>\r\n<table width=\"409\">\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td width=\"197\">\r\n<p><strong>Intransitive Verbs</strong></p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td width=\"212\">\r\n<p><strong>Transitive Verbs</strong></p>\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td width=\"197\">\r\n<p>The door&nbsp;<strong>opens</strong>.</p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td width=\"212\">\r\n<p>I&nbsp;<strong>opened</strong>&nbsp;the door.</p>\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td width=\"197\">\r\n<p>The bell&nbsp;<strong>rang</strong>.</p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td width=\"212\">\r\n<p>She&nbsp;<strong>rang</strong>&nbsp;the bell.</p>\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td width=\"197\">\r\n<p>The light is&nbsp;<strong>fused</strong>.</p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td width=\"212\">\r\n<p>They&nbsp;<strong>fused</strong>&nbsp;the lights.</p>\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td width=\"197\">\r\n<p>The whistle&nbsp;<strong>blew</strong>.</p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td width=\"212\">\r\n<p>Tom&nbsp;<strong>blew</strong>&nbsp;the whistle.</p>\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h2>Phrasal Verb</h2>\r\n<p>A <strong>Phrasal Verb</strong> is an idiomatic phrase that consists of a Verb and another element, most frequently an Adverb or a Preposition.</p>\r\n<p>Examples:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>I'll <strong>see to</strong></li>\r\n<li>She <strong>broke down</strong> in tears.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h2>Lexical Verb</h2>\r\n<p>The main or main verb of a phrase is the <strong>lexical verb</strong>, which generally takes on the main duty of a verb that symbolizes the action of the Noun or Pronoun.</p>\r\n<p>Examples:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>She <strong>ran</strong> to his father.</li>\r\n<li>Atit <strong>tried</strong> her best.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h2>DE-Lexical Verb</h2>\r\n<p><strong>De-lexical</strong> verbs are unimportant in terms of meaning since they seldom have meanings on their own when employed alone. The meaning of the verbs is transferred to the noun. <strong>De-lexical verbs</strong> include words like taking, have, make, give, and so on.</p>\r\n<p>Examples:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>She <strong>took</strong> a shower.</li>\r\n<li>I <strong>had</strong> a cold coffee.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h2>Stative Verb</h2>\r\n<p><strong>Stative or Being Verbs</strong> are verbs that describe the state of being.</p>\r\n<p>Examples:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>You <strong>belong</strong> to the pomp and power.</li>\r\n<li>We <strong>remember</strong> what happened that day.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h2>Dynamic Verb</h2>\r\n<p><strong>Dynamic or Fientive Verbs</strong> are verbs that imply the Subject's continual or progressive action. They represent the Subject's state of movement.</p>\r\n<p>Examples:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Keep <strong>hitting</strong> the basketball hard.</li>\r\n<li>The cat goes for a <strong>walk</strong> every afternoon.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h2>Non-continuous Verb</h2>\r\n<p>The Verbs that are usually never used in their continuous forms are called <strong>Non-continuous Verbs.</strong></p>\r\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n<p>Examples:</p>\r\n<table width=\"544\">\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td width=\"272\">\r\n<p>I&nbsp;<strong>like</strong>&nbsp;to play basketball.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td width=\"272\">\r\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: line-through;\">I'm liking to play basketball.</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td width=\"272\">\r\n<p>I&nbsp;<strong>love</strong>&nbsp;to do the chords.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td width=\"272\">\r\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: line-through;\">I'm loving to do the chords.</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td width=\"272\">\r\n<p>She does not&nbsp;love&nbsp;you.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td width=\"272\">\r\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: line-through;\">She's lovinging you.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: line-through;\">&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td width=\"272\">\r\n<p>He just&nbsp;<strong>feels</strong>&nbsp;a bit dizzy, no need to worry.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td width=\"272\">\r\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: line-through;\">He's just feeling a bit dizzy.</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n<h2>Intensive Verb</h2>\r\n<p><strong>Intensive verbs</strong> are verbs that concentrate their attention solely on the subject.

(Subject you is hidden)</p>\r\n<p>I want to buy a desktop, but I don&rsquo;t have enough funds. (Two independent clauses)</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h2>Dependent Clause</h2>\r\n<p>It cannot feature on its personal as it leaves a concept or concept unfinished. It is likewise known as a subordinate clause. These assist the impartial clauses whole the sentence. Alone, it cannot shape a whole sentence.</p>\r\n<p>The subordinators do the paintings of connecting the structured clause to some other clause to finish the sentence. In every one of the structured clauses, the primary phrase is a subordinator. Subordinators consist of relative pronouns, subordinating conjunctions, and noun clause markers.</p>\r\n<p>Example:</p>\r\n<p>When I was running futsal, I had a bike accident.</p>\r\n<p>I know the man who stole the watch.</p>\r\n<p>He bought an apartment which was too expensive.</p>\r\n<p>I know that he cannot conquer it.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Dependent Clauses are divided into three types and they are &ndash;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>1. Adjective Clause</strong></p>\r\n<p>It is a Dependent Clause that modifies a Noun. Basically, Adjective Clauses have comparable features as Adjectives which might be of enhancing Nouns and therefore the name, Adjective Clause. These also are known as Relative Clauses and they typically take a seat down properly after the Nouns they modify.</p>\r\n<p>Examples:</p>\r\n<p>I&rsquo;m looking for the student card that went missing last Friday.</p>\r\n<p>Clark is asking for the piano which used to belong to his Uncle Matt.</p>\r\n<h3>&nbsp;</h3>\r\n<h3>2. Noun Clause</h3>\r\n<p>Dependent Clauses appearing as Nouns in sentences are referred to as Noun Clauses or Nominal Clauses. These frequently begin with &ldquo;how,&rdquo; &ldquo;that,&rdquo; different WH-words (What, Who, Where, When, Why, Which, Whose and Whom), if, whether or not, etc.</p>\r\n<p>Examples:</p>\r\n<p>I like what I do.</p>\r\n<p>Gita knows how things work around here.</p>\r\n<h3>&nbsp;</h3>\r\n<h3>3. Adverbial Clause</h3>\r\n<p>By definition, those are Dependent Clauses appearing as Adverbs. It method that those clauses have the energy to alter Verbs, Adjectives and different Adverbs.</p>\r\n<p>Examples:</p>\r\n<p>Tina cycled to the point of panting vehemently.</p>\r\n<p>He went through the comic at a lightning speed.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h2>Principal Clause</h2>\r\n<p>These have a Subject (Noun/Pronoun), Finite Verb, and an Object and make complete sentences that may stand by myself or act as the principle a part of any Complex or Compound Sentence. Independent and Principal Clauses are functionally identical however named from distinctive perspectives.</p>\r\n<p>Examples:</p>\r\n<p>I know that man.</p>\r\n<p>He can perform every move.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h2>Coordinate Clause</h2>\r\n<p>Two or greater, in addition, critical Independent Clauses joined through Coordinating Conjunctions (and, or, however, etc.) in phrases of Compound Sentences are known as Coordinate Clauses.</p>\r\n<p>Examples:</p>\r\n<p>I like clicking photos and he loves editing them.</p>\r\n<p>You prefer playing outdoor games but she always wants to play indoor games.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h2>Non-finite Clause</h2>\r\n<p>They include a Participle or an Infinitive Verb that makes the Subject and Verb obvious despite the fact that hidden. In phrases of a Participle, the Participial Phrase takes the region of the Subject or Object of the sentence.</p>\r\n<p>Examples:</p>\r\n<p>He saw the man (who was) staring out of the apartment balcony.</p>\r\n<p>Hearing the gunfire, the children woke up.</p>", "estimated_time": 2.0, "sub_topic": "Clauses: Definition, Types & Examples"}]
